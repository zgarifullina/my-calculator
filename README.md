# my-calculator
An arithmetic calculator

This console application was developed in NetBeans IDE 8.2.
Unit tests are simple C++ tests that use IDE's own simple testing framework.

The calculator implements the Shunting-yard algorithm for conversion of infix notation expressions to postfix, or RPN (Reverse Polish Notation). See details of algorithm here:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shunting-yard_algorithm

Expression in RPN is then evaluated with the use of a stack.
